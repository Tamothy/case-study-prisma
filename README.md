* Clone repository if interested in changing case study
* Use Atom to customize changes
* Make sure to commit regularly on terminal
* Don't forget to push to remote repository

## Known Bugs

Originally there was a bug setting up the GitHub linked pages with index.html, but this was fixed by creating a branch gh-pages through the remote repository. For some reason the GitHub pages doesn't work if you create a local gh-pages branch on your terminal and then pushing gh-pages to your remote repository.
