            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Prisma is an interactive website that allows the user to choose films to watch based on color selection. Here are some of the features:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opponent-process_theory">Opponent-Process Theory</a> - We utilize Ewald Hering theory of color vision to create a contrast feel for Prisma, especially the use of color and the absence of color.</li>
              <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism#/media/File:Light_dispersion_conceptual_waves.gif">Prism Hexademical Back-End</a> - When a user selects a color the back-end outputs a spectrum of hexadecimals associated with the color selection, similar to how a prism outputs a wavelength of a color.</li>
              <li><a href="https://invis.io/HN8PSHODW">Prototype Process</a> - We incorporate a prototype process, effectively switching between subjective and objective perspectives to successfully make the experience feels alive to the user.</li>
            </ul>

          <div class="box">
            <h2>Context and Challenge</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bold">Project background - </span>The purpose of the goal was to create a design that would make the selection of films to watch easier.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">The challenge - </span>The challenge was to creatively think of a design that differentiated from our competitors and also complement our competitors at the same time.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Project goals - </span>Our goal was to create something that was aesthetically pleasing while at the same time provide a functional experience for the user.</li>

            <h2>Process and Insight</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bold">Subjective approach - </span>We began the process by identifying the feeling we want to illicit to the audience, incorporating low fidelity wireframes, utilizing personas, analyzing different generations and experiences, and noticing the top trends in software use.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Objective approach - </span>Once we identify the emotional responses we want our users to feel we then push towards an objective approach, incoporating medium fidelity wireframes, creating mock-up pages, and developing an outline for back-end development.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Prototyping - </span>We use prototyping to portray high fidelity compositions, consistently making sure the subjective and objective are linked as a union, implementing the necessary design principles and development languages to make the feeling come alive.</li>

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Our solution starts with the notion of a prism. When a prism inputs light it outputs wavelengths of colors, not only specific hues, but also including the saturation and lightness of colors.</p>
            </p>We dived into many different theories of color vision, ranging from Trichromatic Theory, Isaac Newton's Color Wheel Theory, and Opponent-Process Theory. We incorporated all three theories in Prisma, but the Oppononent-Process Theory is precedent among all color theories, in such that the theory states that an experience will be much more powerful when opposites are included. For instance, imagine a skydiving experience, the feeling of fear at the beginning with the opposite emotion of relief at the end. We utilize this theory by implementing color and the opposite: <span class="classy">the absence of color</span>.</p>
            <p>When a user chooses a color in Prisma, it will output movie posters associated with the color choice. Our back-end will output a hexadecimal spectrum of the user color choice, imitating the functionality of a prism.</p>

    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <p>I became curious in programming after noticing my kids at work using their smartphones to send messages. During my childhood we would send messages by writing them on paper, folding them up, and then secretly passing them in class without getting caught. Nevertheless, I thought it was interesting to see a new generation of kids sending messages through a programming medium. It's really awesome that programming has changed our ways of communicating, and I want to be a part of that, but sometimes I do miss the <span class="classy">classy</span> way of writing messages on paper.</p>

    <h4>Here are some of my favorite hobbies ranked:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Soccer, hiking, biking, skiing, snowboarding, and pretty much anything outdoors.</li>
      <li>Food. That includes both consuming and cooking food.</li>
      <li>Stories. <strong>Good</strong> stories make you feel something. I like stories that make me feel <em>alive</em>.</li>
