            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Prisma is an interactive website that allows the user to choose films to watch based on color selection. Here are some of the features:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opponent-process_theory">Opponent-Process Theory</a> - We utilize Ewald Hering theory of color vision to create a contrast feel for Prisma, especially the use of color and the absence of color.</li>
              <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism#/media/File:Light_dispersion_conceptual_waves.gif">Prism Hexademical Back-End</a> - When a user selects a color the back-end outputs a spectrum of hexadecimals associated with the color selection, similar to how a prism outputs a wavelength of a color.</li>
              <li><a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main#/console/8927811/191251577/preview">Prototype Process</a> - We incorporate a prototype process, effectively switching between subjective and objective perspectives to successfully make the user feel alive.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Context and Challenge</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bold">Project background - </span>The purpose of the goal was to create a design that would make the selection of films to watch easier.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">The challenge - </span>The challenge was to creatively think of a design that differentiated from our competitors and also complement our competitors at the same time.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Project goals - </span>Our goal was to create something that was aesthetically pleasing while at the same time provide a functional experience for the user.</li>

            <h2>Process and Insight</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bold">Subjective approach - </span>We began the process by identifying the feeling we want to illicit to the audience, incorporating low fidelity wireframes, utilizing personas, analyzing different generations and experiences, and noticing the top trends in software use.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Objective approach - </span>Once we identify the emotional responses we want our users to feel, we then push towards an objective approach, incoporating medium fidelity wireframes, creating mock-up pages, and developing a sense of how to build the back-end.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Prototyping - </span>We use prototyping to portray high fidelity compositions, consistently making sure the subjective and objective are linked as a union, incoporating the necessary design principles and development languages to make the feeling come alive.</li>
