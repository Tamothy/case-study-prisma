            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Prisma is an interactive website that allows the user to choose films to watch based on color selection. Here are some of the features:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opponent-process_theory" target="_blank">Opponent-Process Theory</a> - We utilize Ewald Hering theory of color vision to create a contrast feel for Prisma, especially the use of color and the absence of color.</li>
              <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prism#/media/File:Light_dispersion_conceptual_waves.gif" target="_blank">Prism Hexadecimal Back-End</a> - When a user selects a color the back-end outputs a spectrum of hexadecimals associated with the color selection, similar to how a prism outputs a wavelength of colors.</li>
              <li><a href="https://invis.io/HN8PSHODW" target="_blank">Prototype Process</a> - We incorporate a prototype process, effectively switching between subjective and objective perspectives to successfully make the experience feel alive to the user.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="box">
            <h2>Context and Challenge</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bold">Project background - </span>The purpose of the goal was to create a design that would make the selection of films visually soothing and practical.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">The challenge - </span>The challenge was to creatively think of a design that differentiated from our competitors and also complement our competitors at the same time.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Project goals - </span>Our goal was to create something that was aesthetically pleasing while at the same time provide a functional experience for the user.</li>

            <h2>Process and Insight</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bold">Subjective approach - </span>We began the process by identifying the feeling we want to illicit to the audience, incorporating low fidelity wireframes, utilizing personas, analyzing different generations and experiences, and noticing the top trends in software use.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Objective approach - </span>Once we identifed the emotional responses we want our users to feel we then push towards an objective approach, incorporating medium fidelity wireframes, creating mock-up pages, and developing an outline for back-end development.</li>
              <li><span class="bold">Prototyping - </span>We use prototyping to portray high fidelity compositions, consistently making sure the subjective and objective are linked as a union, implementing the necessary design principles and development languages to make the feeling come alive.</li>

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Our solution starts with the notion of a prism. When a prism inputs light it outputs a wavelength of colors, not only specific hues, but also including the saturation and lightness of colors.</p>
            <p>When a user chooses a color, it will output film posters associated with the color choice. Our back-end will output a hexadecimal spectrum of the user color choice, imitating the functionality of a prism.</p>
            </p>We analyzed many different theories of color vision, ranging from Trichromatic Theory, Isaac Newton's Color Wheel Theory, and Opponent-Process Theory. We incorporated all three theories in Prisma, however the Opponent-Process Theory is precedent among all color theories, in such that the theory suggests that an experience will be much more powerful when opposites are included. For instance, imagine a skydiving experience, the feeling of fear at the beginning with the emotion of relief at the end. We utilize this theory by implementing color and the opposite: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opponent-process_theory" class="red_link" target="_blank">the absence of color</a>.</p>

                <h2 class="center">Result</h2>
                <p>The result is <a href="https://invis.io/HN8PSHODW" class="red_link" target="_blank">Prisma</a>: an interactive film experience that makes the user feel alive through color selection.</p>
                <ol>
                  <li><p>The user selects a color of choice and the outcome is a list of film posters uploaded by other Prisma accounts.</p></li>
                  <li><p>Once a film is selected we then let the user have the option to either: check out ratings for the film, watch the film, or subscribe to the user's account.</li>
                  <li><p>We utilize the Opponent-Process Theory by implementing grayscale profile accounts and the color poster choosen by the user, providing an experience that's aesthetically pleasing and functionally interactive.</li>
